                Barak is the 7th hostel in the IITG fraternity and derives its
                name from the River Barak which is a major river in
                north-eastern India and is a part of the Surma-Meghna River
                System. It rises in the Manipur hills and enters the plains near
                Lakhipur. The two time General Championship Winner hostel brings
                a cheerful environment to all its boarders.
